      <p class="fifth-paragraph">
        I am writing you concerning a recent purchase of promotional items.
        Approximately two weeks ago, on May 1, I ordered a total of 500
        promotional items for Company, Inc. via the Promotional items webpage. I
        received an email notification within three hours confirming the receipt
        of payment via credit card and the prompt shipment of promotional items.
        Your website indicated, shipments should reach their destination within
        3-5 business days of being sent, but I am eagerly awaiting to receive
        the promotional items. Do you have any information on what may have
        happened with shipment or where the shipment is located?
      </p>
      <p class="sixth-paragraph">
        I have worked with name of company before and have confidence in your
        product lines and excellent customer service. The shipment of
        promotional items must arrive soon, and I hoped you might be able to
        provide me with an idea of when I can receive them in our office. Thank
        you in advance for assistance you may provide regarding the purchase.
      </p>
      <p class="seventh-paragraph">Sincerely,</p>
